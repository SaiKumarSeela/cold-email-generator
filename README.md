# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator
Developed a cold email generator application using Llama 3.1 and the Groq API. The application allows users to input a job post link and their resume in PDF format. It extracts relevant skills, roles, and experiences from the job description, retrieves project links from a Chroma vector database, and generates a personalized cold email for HR. This tool streamlines the job application process by creating tailored outreach messages.
